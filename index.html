            <div class="grid-item"><p1>Welcome to the Hot Beans Web Website! At Hot Beans Web we help our businesses and companies develop websites by using our teams software engineering skills and design work. However, if a business has a design in mind we take into account what the customer wants and build a website around their ideas! As our company grows and gains more and more employees we will be able to start designing for many websites at once and potentially even bigger brand websites. We hope you want to look around our website and hopefully apply for our jobs out currently (read further for more details).</p1></div>

                <div class="grid-item"><p2>We are currently looking for more team members to help develop websites or lead projects for our current teams at Hot Beans Web, we will welcome you with open arms to our new company. You could go into various roles such as a Project Manager, Security Manager, A Frontend or Backend developer, a Finance Manager, A graphic designer or even a Tester for our websites. All these different roles require different kinds of qualifications which you can find out about on our "Application" page further into the website. One role we are in urgent need for is a website developer for our own website as most of our current website developers are students and cannot make a website to our desired quality.</p2></div>
